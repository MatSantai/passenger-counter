A simple web application to count and track the number of people entering a location, such as a station. The app allows you to increment a counter, save the current count, and keep a running total of all entries.

## Features

- Save the current count and reset the counter
- Display a list of previous entries

- Stylish interface with a background image

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Click **INCREMENT** to increase the count.
3. Click **SAVE** to add the current count to the list of previous entries and update the total. The counter will reset to zero.
4. The "Previous entries" section will show all saved counts, and the "Total" section will display the cumulative total.
